# Data_Analysis_with_Python

Data analysis and, in essence, data science, helps us unlock the information and insights from raw data to answer our questions. 
So data analysis plays an important role by helping us to discover useful information from the data, answer questions, and even predict the future or the unknown. 

Important steps:

1) Importing Datasets

   * First step is to open dataset of used cars (clean_df.csv) by Jeffrey C. Schlemmer. 
   * This dataset is in CSV format, which separates each of the values with commas making it very easy to import in most tools or applications. 

2) Data Wrangling

   Data preprocessing is often called data cleaning or data wrangling. It is the process of converting or mapping data from one “raw” form into another format to make it ready for further analysis.
   
   This module includes:
   * identify and handle missing values.
   * data formats. 
   * data normalization(Centering/Scaling). 
   * data binning. 
   * convert categorical values into numeric variables.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis

   Exploratory data analysis or in short, EDA is an approach to analyze data in order to summarize main characteristics of the data.
   
   Topics coverd in this module are: 
   * Descriptive Statistics, which describe basic features of a data set, and obtain a short summary about the sample and measures of the data.
   * Basic of grouping data using GroupBuy, and how this can help to transform our data set.
   * ANOVA,the analysis of variance, a statistical method in which the variation in a set of observations is divided into distinct components.
   * The Correlation between different variables.
   * Advance Correlation - Statistics, where various correlations statistical methods namely, Pearson correlation, and correlation heatmaps are used.

4) Model Development
  
   A model or estimator can be thought of as a mathematical equation which is used to predict a value given one or more other values and relating one or more independent  variables or features to dependent variables. 
   
   In this module the below topics are included-  
   * simple and multiple linear regression
   * model evaluation using visualization(regression plot, residual plot and distribution plot)
   * polynomial regression and pipelines
   * R-squared and MSE for in-sample evaluation

5) Model Evaluation and Refinement

   Model Model Evaluation is an integral part of the model development process. 
   
   It helps to find the best model that represents our data and how well the chosen model will work in the future.
   
   This module includes:
   * Splitting the data into training and testing data
   * Overfitting, underfitting and model selection
   * Ridge regression
   * Grid search

   Libraries Used : Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, sklearn
   
   Tasks Performed on the dataset:
   
   a) Importing Data
    	
   	* Import of Data (csv file) using Pandas
        * Understanding the data
      
   b) Data Wrangling
   
	* Analyzing Dataset values
	* Finding an replacing NaN values
      
   c) Exploratory Data Analysis
   
        * Using functions to obtain value count of houses that fall under certain conditions
	* Plotting data to check for the presence of outliers
	* Understanding correlation in the data
      
   d) Model Development
  
	* Scaling the data
	* Fitting a Regression Model
	* Predictions using a list of features
	* Obtaining R^2 value and analysing this score
      
   e) Model Refinement and Evaluation
   
	* Splitting the data into training and testing data
	* Using Ridge regression to introduce a regularization parameter
	* Fitting a regression model
	* Making predictions using data
	* Obtaining a score to check the performance of model
      
   f) Refining the model by 
  
        * performing a polynomial transform on the data
	* Analyzing the model performance
